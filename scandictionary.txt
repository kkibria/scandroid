# This file holds a dictionary intended for use by the Scandroid. It's made
# on the assumption that the Syllabizer() will do the job it does as of about
# 7.i.05; I list here only words that that routine won't handle correctly.
# (More could be done to whittle this down, but not much, I think, that would
# whittle it far. As it is, this list of well under 1,000 words represents
# 1/5 of the words in the old PROSE.DIC file; and 80% is pretty good.)
# The encoding, too, is obviously designed in conjunction with what
# the Scandroid's functions expect. And by the way, I'm sure many of these
# syllabifications are WRONG, according to the dictionary; I'm tending to 
# err on the side of equalizing the lengths of syllables, since the 
# appearance of the Scandroid's output will be improved thereby, and actual 
# syllable divisions won't be visible to the user.
# 
# Notes: polysyllabic words whose stress is ambiguous (especially, dependent 
# on part of speech) are encoded as if without stress; the calling function
# has to make what it can of them. Rule: the syllable-encoded version has 
# the same number of characters (except blanks) as the original and indeed 
# the same spelling. No caps! any capitalization of words *displayed* in the
# program is according to input text, not manipulables here. Note that it's 
# my idiolect that's represented here; 'con tent' is stress-ambiguous, 
# 'de FENSE' is not.
#
# Principles to keep in mind, to keep dictionary from growing too much 
# under hand-editing: Don't include any monosyllable that ought to be
# stressed (unless syllabification is ambiguous); that will be the default.
# Hyphens will be stripped before a search, so only components should
# be listed in the dictionary. Apostrophes are treated like letters, so
# including "it's" and "its" makes sense.
#
# Update: I've made a few additions, and about 160 deletions, after revisions
# to the Syllabizer.
# Also, changes in the Scansion Machine's method PromotePyrrhics (though it
# may be in for major changes of other kinds), in particular the outlawing of
# pyrrhics before trochees, strongly suggest that the forms of "to be" should
# be recorded as ambiguous. That's implemented here, at first experimentally.
