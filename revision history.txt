REVISION HISTORY

Yet to Be Done:
-- invent a way to validate user's entries in the dictionary-edit dialog
-- find way to deal with phrasal verbs
-- allow proportional fonts and user-choosable fonts
-- make line numbers smart (exclude blanks, titles)
-- handle digits in verse ("12" -> "twelve")

1.2 -
-- code ported to python 3.7.3
-- cleaned up to support pyinstaller 4.4

1.1 -
-- major change in architecture: when a file is loaded, to deduce the metrical
	parameters the program now tries out all stress resolutions on the sample
	lines (as well as both iambic and anapestic scansions, and both iambic
	algorithms). This and other tuning has made the detection of metron and
	line-length more reliable
-- added a supplementary algorithm for determining the length of anapestic 
	lines (counting non-adjacent stresses)
-- added a Reload Dictionary button in case user wants to discard changes
	made for one poem-file when loading another
-- expanded and improved recognition of promoted stresses in anapestics
-- if user forces metron, line-length is now refigured
-- added crude large-scale error-trapping to report location of crash-sites
-- fixed crash while deducing parameters of poem with short lines
-- extended Copy capability to text and scan work-boxes
-- added -tious, -cious to suffixes
-- multiple small changes (but they add up!) in syllabification/stress-guessing
	code, coordinated with changes in dictionary; somewhat better, but
	*different* performance with any arbitrary vocabulary
-- massive, though incomplete, revision and rationalization of code


1.0a - 
-- added routines to scan anapestic verse, both step-by-step and in quick
	run-through; many iterations of this code
-- added top-level code to determine metron (iamb or anapest) and line-length
	(if clear) by sampling lines in any Loaded file; many iterations of this code
-- added status bar to reflect metron, line-length
-- improved dictionary-edit dialog: layout, "words" including one hyphen, etc.
-- fixed Win/Mac word-selection difference in dictionary-edit dialog
-- added optional display of line numbers for text (though not "smart" ones)
-- added handling of clitics such as "th'"
-- added Select-All and Copy-to-clipboard for Notes and Text panels
-- added Find for Text panel
-- refined treatment of promoted stresses in iambics
-- updated and enlarged .pdf manual


0.3 - (never released as such)
-- cleaned up code, added docstrings to most functions
-- improved code for selecting next unscanned line
-- added provision in dictionary for stress-ambiguous monosyllables and
	polysyllables)
-- added stress-ambiguity resolution, so that function choosing between
	iambic algorithms examines multiple possible lexical-stress candidates
-- added measure-complexity function to aid in choice among stress-resolution
	possibilities and between algorithms


0.2a - first release under GPL
-- two-algorithm scansion of iambic pentameters (only)
-- step-by-step scansion with displayed explanations
-- dictionary-edit dialog to correct syllabification and stress
-- load and save poem-text files
-- manual in .pdf format
