Scans English verse in iambic and anapestic meters. The  version 1.1 source is copied from [Charles O. Hartman's page](https://oak.conncoll.edu/cohar/Programs.htm).

My ultimate goal is to use this for song lyric writing.

## Metrical Foot
It is an unit consists of a pattern of stressed and unstress syllables.

*Iambic*: Pronounced duh-DUH. Consists of two syllables- an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable. An iamb can be made up of one word with two syllables or two different words.

*Trochee*: Pronounced DUH-duh. A line of verse with one or more trochees is said to have a trochaic meter. This stress pattern is the opposite of iambic meter.

*Spondee*: Spondees have two stressed syllables, pronounced DUH-DUH.

*Dactyl*: Dactyls are pronounced DUH-duh-duh. This foot has a stressed syllable followed by two unstressed syllables.

*Anapest*: Pronounced duh-duh-DUH. Anapestic meter typically divides its syllables across multiple words.
